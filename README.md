# Rooth-Model


This Project is aimed at creating a simulation of the Rooth Model of Ocean Circulation as outlined in 
"Ocean Gyres and Abrupt Change in the Thermohaline Circulation:A Conceptual Analysis" by Longworth et al. 
This is designed to reproduce the findings of the aforementioned paper while creating a program that will
Effectively allow for more rigorous experimentation with the Rooth Model for ongoing Oceanic Research. This is 
Critical for understanding the Thermo Haline Current (THC) throughout the oceans and will aide in understanding 
Of ongoing climate change.
